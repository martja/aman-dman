# AMAN for EuroScope

AMAN is an Arrival Management tool designed to help approach and en-route controllers build stable, predictable arrival sequences into busy airports. It works as a decision-support tool: it does not control aircraft, but continuously analyzes inbound traffic and advises controllers how to keep the flow smooth. The system is inspired by real-world AMAN concepts used in Europe, but simplified and adapted for virtual ATC environments like VATSIM.

Features:

- **Custom trajectory prediction**: Utilizes aircraft performance data and wind information to predict arrival times accurately.
- **Automatic sequencing**: Automatically sequences incoming aircraft based on their optimal arrival times and required separation.
- **Master and slave mode**: Supports master-slave configuration for shared AMAN data between multiple controllers.

## What AMAN Is (and Is Not)

**AMAN is:**
- A planning and sequencing tool  
- A workload reducer during high traffic  
- A realistic simulation of real-world arrival management  

**AMAN is not:**
- An autopilot  
- A replacement for ATC judgement  
- A rigid or mandatory system  

Controllers are always in charge.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- EuroScope installed on your computer.
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed (version 21 or higher). This can be downloaded from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/EvenAR/aman-dman/releases).
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.
3. Load the EuroScope bridge plugin `Aman.dll` file from the extracted folder.
4. Run the .jar file to start the AMAN application.

When the application starts, right click on the window bar and select "Start new timeline group".

### Configuration

See example configuration [here](https://github.com/EvenAR/aman-dman/tree/main/aman-dman-client/config). When downloading the release files you will find `*.schema.yaml`-files where all possible values are listed. 

- `airports.yaml`: To be able to connect the AMAN to an airport, the airport location and all its runway thresholds must be defined in this file.
- `settings.yaml`: This defines the available timeline configurations for each airport.
- `stars/<airport-icao>`: (optional) These files should define typical altitudes and airspeed along each STAR for an airport. This will make descent trajectories and estimated landing times more accurate.

💡 Tip: Install the [VSCode YAML extension from Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) to get help writing valid config files.

Please visit [the wiki](https://github.com/EvenAR/aman-dman/wiki) for more information.

### ⚠️ Current Limitations

- Supported aircraft types are limited to those listed [here](https://github.com/EvenAR/aman-dman/blob/main/aman-dman-client/config/aircraft-performance.yaml). If no performance data exists for an aircraft type, an ETA cannot be calculated and the aircraft will not appear on the timeline.
- The application assumes that all pilots are using **live real-world weather** in their simulator.
- Currently, only timelines based on **landing time** are supported. In the future, it might also be possible to create timelines for inbound **fixes**.
- Local QNH and air temperature are not currently accounted for in the descent trajectory. This is expected to have only a minor impact on ETA accuracy.

## Development

### Java Application

[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows) (Community Edition) is a great IDE for Kotlin development.

**Running the application from IntelliJ:**

1. Open Project → select the `aman-dman-client` directory.
2. Go to **Menu → Project Structure**:
   - Select JDK 21 (e.g., `temurin-21`)
   - Set **Language Level**: 21
3. Open the file `app/src/kotlin/.../Main.kt` and press the green arrow next to `fun main()` to run the project.

### EuroScope Bridge

If you need to make changes to the EuroScope bridge C++ plugin you should use [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).

**Debugging with Visual Studio:**

1. Open the project in the `euroscope-bridge` directory (double-click `Aman.sln`).
2. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click on **Aman** → **Properties**.
3. Under the **Debugging** page, navigate to your installation directory of `EuroScope.exe` and apply the changes.
4. Run **Local Windows Debugger**.  
   If everything works correctly, a `.dll` file is written to `euroscope-bridge\Debug`.
5. Load the `.dll` plugin in EuroScope.

## Contributing

This project benefits most when behavioral changes are shared.

If you fork the repository to experiment, that’s great — but if you change sequencing logic, trajectory modeling, or AMAN behavior, please consider submitting a Pull Request so improvements can be shared and discussed.

The goal is not to be “perfect”, but to converge on realistic and understandable behavior.
